Project Title: Quakemon 2 A mod which incorporates Pokemon inspired gameplay into Quake 2. Once you start a single player game, the f1 button will show you the controls on how to play, which I will go over now in more detail.

How to install: Download the files and make a folder in your Quake 2 folder. Then, make a build from game in the files using something like visual studio, and have that build go to that folder you created. In the folder, then duplicate the config file and call it autoexec. Here, you can copy paste the autoexec text I have below the how to play section. After that, you should be set, enjoy the Dosgg region! 

How to Play: Spawn Mon Button 'J': By pressing J, you can spawn in a new mon. This can be done during a battle, or just continuously to cycle through the 10 available mons until you reach one you would like to interact with.

Capture Button 'K': By pressing K, you will catch the mon that you are seeing in front of you. Beware though, you can only have one mon caught at a time, and once you catch a new mon, it overrides your past mon. A "Catched mon" text will show up on the screen when you catch a mon.

Turn Based Battle Button 'L': By pressing L, you release your captured mon and are in the turn based battle phase, shown by the "Battle Start" in the middle of the screen, you can either catch, fight, or run from the wild monster. Catch: Press K. Your previous mon would be replaced by this one since you can only have one mon at a time, but you can switch them as much as you like.

Fight: On the bottom middle of your screen, you can see your mon's health, and on the right side of the text that shows up with each move, you can see your opponent's health. On the middle, you can also see text of what move you just did and what move the opponent just did. You can choose from 4 moves which can be used by pressing the buttons 2,3,4,5. Simply press the button of the move you want to use, they are in the following order and will be on the help screen if you need a reminder. The 4 moves are:

Tackle - a normal attack which just subtracts some health from the opponent. Protect - a defensive attack which protects you from the next attack your opponent throws. Swords Dance - a supportive attack which increases the amount of damage you do to the opponent. Growl - a attack which decreases the amount of damage your opponent does to you.

Each time you use a move, the opponent then also uses one of these four moves on you, and this will all be shown in the text on the middle of the screen. The fight will continue until one of the mons runs out of health. If they lose, you win, if you lose, you need to reload at a save in the heal shop so your mon can be healed.

Run: If you are in the turn battle phase and don't want to fight, just press J and a new mon will appear.

HealShop: Heal: If you press 'H', you will use the healshop which will heal your mon. If you ever lose a battle, you will load up in the heal shop since it heals you. If your mons are just weak, press H to heal your mon back to full health.

Shop: If you press H and open the healshop with a win, you gain access to 5 items. 

Items: There are 5 items which you can get from the healshop. You get all 5 after engaging in the healshop with a win. Keep in mind, while items are powerful, they let opponents attack you twice since you have to focus to use them. They are also represented as buttons like the moves, this time being the buttons 6,7,8,9,0. Just click the button of the item you want to use. The items are as follows, and in the following order. Protection Breaker: This item takes away the ability for a mon to use Protect for the rest of the fight. Will Breaker: This item greatly lowers the attack of the opposing mon.  Attack Enhancer: This item greatly increases the attack of your mon. Gemini Split: This item lets your mon do an attack worth twice the damage. Olympic Mead: This item heals your mon to double it's normal health.

Fight and catch mons to your heart's content!

Your grand adventure in the Dosgg region awaits!
